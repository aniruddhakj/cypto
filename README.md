Simple simulation of a CryptoCurrency Market using Java-Swing for UE19CS352 project


### Title of the Project 

Crypto Trading Platform

### Description of Project

Despite its name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the conventional sense, and while they have received several classifications, including commodities, securities, and currencies, cryptocurrencies are typically regarded as an unique asset class in practice. 
Cryptocurrencies are mostly looked at as an investment similar to stocks but they differ in the sense that there is huge fluctuation in even the most stable cryptocurrencies in real time. 
This implies that one must have a keen mind and high levels of preparedness in order to profit off of a cryptocurrency market. 
For stocks, we already have dummy trading or paper trading as it is normally called, in place. 
Nothing of this sort can be found for cryptocurrencies.
This motivated us to make our own dummy crypto trading platform - CYPTO, which would help teach newcomers how to invest in crypto and maximise their profits.
